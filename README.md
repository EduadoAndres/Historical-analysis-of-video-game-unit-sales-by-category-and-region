Course project offered by Datdata on Udemy - Power BI Data Analysis and Business Intelligence Course

It starts with a somewhat messy Dataset in terms of the columns of total sales by region

After a few transformations:

Removed Total Sales column
In the region columns (4) the dynamism was removed to have all the regions in a single column
Updated the name of the regions
The date column

A Card with the total copies sold
A bar graph with the percentage sold by region
A column chart with cumulative sales by year and region
A bar chart with cumulative sales by year and region
A bar graph with the accumulated sales by platform and region
A column chart with cumulative sales by gender and by region
A table with the details, name of the video games, sales, platform, genre and publisher
Similarly 5 filters were added:
